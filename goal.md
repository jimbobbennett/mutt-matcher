# Goal: Provide a challenge-based scenario

As highlighted in the intro, the primary focus is around the scenario rather than the technology. We want to highlight what the hacker will do in real-world terms, to highlight the problems the various technologies solve.

Use phrasing like "your team" to encourage teamwork, and to connect with the hacker.

## The Azure Service (or other consistent header)

We want to **briefly** introduce the technology we expect the hacker to use to complete the goal. A couple of paragraphs describing the benefits and common uses is perfect. We don't want to provide step-by-step instructions, but rather point to documentation and Learn modules in the [Resources](#resources) section.

## Key files

If there are any files part of the [starter code](./obtain-starter.md) the hacker will use or needs to be explained, you can do that in this section.

## Success criteria

The success criteria should be **clearly** laid out so the hacker knows exactly what is expected of her. It's OK to use whatever technical terms are necessary to lay things out.

Examples:

- The shelter's site has been successfully deployed to Azure Static Web Apps
- Your team's IoT device sends data to Azure (or whatever IoT does)
- Your team's bot is able to answer questions about the adoption process

## Validation

See Christopher for information about automating validation.

## Resources

Provide a list of links to docs and Learn modules which provide the necessary steps the hacker needs to perform to achieve the goal. Include pointers to background information about the services as appropriate. Feel free to provide multiple options (CLI, Portal, Visual Studio Code, etc.) to complete the tasks.

If docs or a Learn module isn't available, it's time to create one! One of the goals of this style of workshop is to validate the documentation. After all, when the hacker actually starts hacking they'll need to rely on documentation and Learn; if they can't, then this is a bug we should fix.

## Tips

Provide any hints or other possible pitfalls for the student.

## Final result

Summarize what the hackers will have done, and provide a screenshot.

## Next challenge
