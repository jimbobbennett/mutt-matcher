# Obtain starter code or other prerequisite steps

The **entire workshop** should take the average student hacker about an hour to complete. Needless to say this isn't a lot of time. As a result, we want to ensure we focus on the skills we want a hacker to learn. The hacker should not build everything from scratch unless it's possible to be completed within the time frame highlighted above.

## Starter code

Any starter code can be provided as a [GitHub template](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/creating-a-template-repository). By using a template rather than a fork, a disconnect is created between the starter code and the hacker's project. You can add the starter code to the same repository which hosts the workshop.

## Installation steps for any prerequisite software

We want to limit the setup required to get started whenever possible. Having a hacker install Docker, configure a container, and connecting to a service will eat into the short amount of time alloted for the workshop. Unless a service or tool is absolutely necessary we should avoid it.

If there is anything which needs to be installed, provide any links or other instructions necessary.
