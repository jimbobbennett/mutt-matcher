# Goal 0: Set up your PC or Mac

If you don't have a Raspberry Pi to use, you can simulate one using your PC or Mac, with a built in or external web cam.

## Configure your OS

The code will use [OpenCV](https://opencv.org) to capture images from your camera, so you will need to install this.

To install OpenCV, you can follow the instructions for your OS in the [Introduction to OpenCV documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.3/df/d65/tutorial_table_of_content_introduction.html).

The code for the IoT device is Python, so you will need to have a recent version of Python installed. You can install this from the [Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you don't already have it installed.

## Next challenge

Once your PC or Mac is ready, it's time to [train the ML model](./train-model).
