# Scenario: The Workshop Template

This repository is the template for hack-themed workshops. Please use the **Use this template** option to create a new workshop. The template structure provides inline instructions, tips and tricks for creating workshops. You can review [The Loved Mutt](https://github.com/GeekTrainer/loved-mutt) for an example.

The most important aspect to a hack-based workshop is the scenario or story. We want to provide background on the social problem we would be looking to address in this workshop, and give context to why a hacker would choose particular technologies. A couple of paragraphs is all that's needed. We want to focus on the story first; the technology is the tool hackers will use to solve the goals put forth in the workshop.

## Prerequisites

List all prerequisites a hacker will need. This would include:

- Skills
  - Programming languages
  - Git
  - Frameworks
- Software
  - Git
  - Visual Studio Code
  - Runtimes and interpreters

## Resources

You can use the following boilerplate. The goal of this section in the readme is to give context of what the hacker will see for each goal.

> A series of resources will be provided to help your team determine the appropriate steps for completion. The resources provided should provide your team with enough information to achieve each goal. If you get stuck, you can always ask a mentor for additional help.

## Goals

List all goals/goals the hacker will complete during the workshop.

1. [Clone the repository or obtain any necessary code](obtain-starter.md)
1. [A series of one or more goals](goal.md)

# Where do we go from here?

As highlighted earlier, we are looking to provide inspiration to hackers on what can be done with Azure and other products. List possible next steps a hacker could take to build upon the scenario.
